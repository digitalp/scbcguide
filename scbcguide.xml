It doesn't, says Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò -- it has a knowledge crisis. Táíwò suggests that lack of knowledge on important topics like water and food is what stands between Africa's current state and a future of prosperity. In a powerful talk, he calls for Africa to make the production of knowledge within the continent rewarding and reclaim its position as a locus of learning on behalf of humanity.</desc></programme><programme start="20240223070000 +0100" stop="20240223080000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Aljazeera News Live</title><title lang="en">Aljazeera News Live</title><sub-title lang="en" /><sub-title lang="en" /><desc lang="en" /><desc lang="en" /></programme><programme start="20240223080000 +0100" stop="20240223090000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en" /><sub-title lang="en" /><desc lang="en" /></programme><programme start="20240223090000 +0100" stop="20240223094600 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="eng">Heart Beat</title><title lang="en">Heart Beat</title><sub-title lang="eng">Episode 01</sub-title><sub-title lang="en">Episode 1</sub-title><desc lang="eng">Rüzgar goes to Bosnia after losing the woman he loves in a car crash two years ago, to run away from everything and everyone but mostly his memories..
