But the youngest in the family, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), got into a scuffle with his older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) and was sent to his room, which is on the third floor of his house. Then, the next morning, while the rest of the family was in a rush to make it to the airport on time, they completely forgot about Kevin, who now has the house all to himself. Being home alone was fun for Kevin, having a pizza all to himself, jumping on his parents' bed, and making a mess. Then, Kevin discovers about two burglars, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), about to rob his house on Christmas Eve. Kevin acts quickly by wiring his own house with makeshift booby traps to stop the burglars and to bring them to justice.</desc></programme><programme start="20231230070000 +0100" stop="20231230071700 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="eng">TED Talk</title><title lang="en">TED Talk</title><sub-title lang="eng">100 solutions to reverse global warming</sub-title><sub-title lang="en">100 solutions to reverse global warming</sub-title><desc lang="eng">What if we took out more greenhouse gases than we put into the atmosphere?

A desperate mother decides to let God guide her newborn son instead of execution.

As time passes, the two brothers are separated as Moses discovers his true heritage as a Hebrew and defies the Egyptian way of life.
