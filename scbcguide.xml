Chris can't seem to correct the problem and is furious with Joy, saying he'll never forgive her. SUPERBOOK intercedes and whisks the kids back to the days of Jacob and Esau. The two brothers compete over many things, but when Esau gives up his birthright and Jacob tricks his father out of a blessing they become estranged for many years thereafter. Chris and Joy witness the animosity between the two brothers and the separation it has caused them for years. Chris begins to think about his own unforgiving attitude with Joy. When Jacob finally goes to Esau and his brother finds it in his heart to forgive Jacob, Chris takes the cue and forgives Joy as well and the two are best friends once again. And they work together to repair Gizmo's still-comical malfunctioning microchip.</desc></programme><programme start="20240205152800 +0100" stop="20240205155500 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Superbook</title><sub-title lang="en">S1.E4 ∙ Exodus: Let My People Go</sub-title><desc lang="en">On a lazy afternoon, Chris Joy and Gizmo are hanging out in the lab recalling the great adventures they've had with Superbook. This prompts Gizmo to question whether they've yet experienced THE GREATEST Bible story of all time. In answer to his question, Superbook whisks the kids away to meet Moses as he is chosen by God to free the Israelites from their bondage in Egypt. During the course of the adventure, our young heroes make it through the plagues, the Exodus from Egypt, and ultimately to the parting of the Red Sea. When the kids return home, they know they have seen God's awesome power at work and believe it must be the greatest bible story ever. At first they are a bit disheartened, believing that if that was the best, most important bible story of all time, then what have they got left to look forward to? However, they quickly perk up when they realize there are hundreds more stories to visit and each one will have it's own unique appeal and adventure.</desc></programme><programme start="20240205155500 +0100" stop="20240205155900 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="eng">Music</title><title lang="en">Music</title><sub-title lang="eng">Music</sub-title><sub-title lang="en">Music</sub-title><desc lang="eng">Music</desc><desc lang="en">African Music</desc></programme><programme start="20240205155900 +0100" stop="20240205163200 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Paternity Court</title><sub-title lang="en">My EX Won't Accept Our Child </sub-title><desc lang="en">1.
