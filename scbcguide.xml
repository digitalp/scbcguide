Or when they don't turn at all? Vivek Maru is working to transform the relationship between people and law, turning law from an abstraction or threat into something that everyone can understand, use and shape. Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions. Learn more about how this innovative approach to using the law is helping socially excluded people claim their rights. "A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way," Maru says.</desc></programme><programme start="20240109144800 +0100" stop="20240109150000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">TED Talk</title><sub-title lang="en">A few ways to fix a government | Charity Wayua</sub-title><desc lang="en">Charity Wayua put her skills as a cancer researcher to use on an unlikely patient: the government of her native Kenya.
