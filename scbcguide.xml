This sparks riots among school age young people who have resolved to do what it takes for freedom to come tomorrow. In a township of Soweto, a group of students, led by a beautiful and intelligent young girl, Sarafina, mastermind a plot to rise against the apartheid regime by vehemently rejecting the proposal to have Afrikaans as a medium of instruction. This angers the white people and results in a massive unrest of the students and those others supporting them. Meanwhile, Sarafina's mother accepts a job of a housekeeper in a white household and it angers Sarafina. Following the unrest of students and their possible torture and trial, Sarafina is released from prison, reunites with some of the colleagues and composes a "Freedom is Coming Tomorrow" song</desc></programme><programme start="20240105134000 +0100" stop="20240105140000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Ted Talk</title><sub-title lang="en">How to put the power of law in people's hands | Vivek Maru</sub-title><desc lang="en">What can you do when the wheels of justice don't turn fast enough? Or when they don't turn at all? Vivek Maru is working to transform the relationship between people and law, turning law from an abstraction or threat into something that everyone can understand, use and shape. Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions. Learn more about how this innovative approach to using the law is helping socially excluded people claim their rights. "A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way," Maru says.</desc></programme><programme start="20240105140000 +0100" stop="20240105142300 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="eng">Paw Patrol</title><title lang="en">Paw Patrol </title><sub-title lang="eng">Pups Save the Chili Cook-Off</sub-title><sub-title lang="en">Pups Save the Chili Cook-Off</sub-title><desc lang="eng">Mr. Porter's stove explodes right before the chili cook-off!</desc><desc lang="en">Mr. Porter's stove explodes right before the chili cook-off!</desc></programme><programme start="20240105142300 +0100" stop="20240105143700 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Inside a Lost African Tribe</title><sub-title lang="en">Inside a Lost African Tribe Still Living in India Today | Short Film Showcase</sub-title><desc lang="en">In the dense forests of South Asia, a native African tribe has been living in quiet obscurity for more than 500 years.</desc></programme><programme start="20240105143700 +0100" stop="20240105150000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">House of Lords</title><sub-title lang="en">House of Lords</sub-title><desc lang="en">Lord Boateng</desc></programme><programme start="20240105150000 +0100" stop="20240105154400 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Sisiku Ayuk Tabe -

This sparks riots among school age young people who have resolved to do what it takes for freedom to come tomorrow. In a township of Soweto, a group of students, led by a beautiful and intelligent young girl, Sarafina, mastermind a plot to rise against the apartheid regime by vehemently rejecting the proposal to have Afrikaans as a medium of instruction. This angers the white people and results in a massive unrest of the students and those others supporting them. Meanwhile, Sarafina's mother accepts a job of a housekeeper in a white household and it angers Sarafina. Following the unrest of students and their possible torture and trial, Sarafina is released from prison, reunites with some of the colleagues and composes a "Freedom is Coming Tomorrow" song</desc></programme><programme start="20240106164800 +0100" stop="20240106165900 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">House of Lords</title><sub-title lang="en">Lord Grantchester (Labour)</sub-title><desc lang="en">Lord Grantchester (Labour)</desc></programme><programme start="20240106165900 +0100" stop="20240106174400 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 6</title><sub-title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 6</sub-title><desc lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 6</desc></programme><programme start="20240106174400 +0100" stop="20240106183000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 7 </title><sub-title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 7 </sub-title><desc lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 7 </desc></programme><programme start="20240106183000 +0100" stop="20240106191400 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 8</title><sub-title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 8</sub-title><desc lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 8</desc></programme><programme start="20240106191400 +0100" stop="20240106200000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en" /><sub-title lang="en" /><desc lang="en" /></programme><programme start="20240106200000 +0100" stop="20240106220100 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Blade</title><sub-title lang="en">Blade</sub-title><desc lang="en">In a world where vampires walk the earth, Blade has a goal.

The Reaper. A vampire so consumed with an insatiable bloodlust that they prey on vampires as well as humans, transforming victims who are unlucky enough to survive into Reapers themselves. Now their quickly expanding population threatens the existence of vampires, and soon there won't be enough humans in the world to satisfy their bloodlust. Blade, Whistler and an armory expert named Scud are curiously summoned by the Shadow Council. The council reluctantly admits that they are in a dire situation and they require Blade's assistance. Blade then tenuously enters into an alliance with The Bloodpack, an elite team of vampires trained in all modes of combat to defeat the Reaper threat. Blade's team and the Bloodpack are the only line of defense which can prevent the Reaper population from wiping out the vampire and human populations.</desc></programme><programme start="20240106235800 +0100" stop="20240107054400 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="eng">Music</title><title lang="en">Music</title><sub-title lang="eng">Music</sub-title><sub-title lang="en">Music</sub-title><desc lang="eng">Music</desc><desc lang="en">African Music</desc></programme><programme start="20240107054400 +0100" stop="" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">TED Talk</title><sub-title lang="en">TED Talk - How Africa can use its traditional knowledge to make progress   Chika Ezeanya-Esiobu</sub-title><desc lang="en">Chika Ezeanya-Esiobu wants to see Africans unleash their suppressed creative and innovative energies by acknowledging the significance of their indigenous, authentic knowledge.
