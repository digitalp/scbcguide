The two brothers compete over many things, but when Esau gives up his birthright and Jacob tricks his father out of a blessing they become estranged for many years thereafter. Chris and Joy witness the animosity between the two brothers and the separation it has caused them for years. Chris begins to think about his own unforgiving attitude with Joy.

In answer to his question, Superbook whisks the kids away to meet Moses as he is chosen by God to free the Israelites from their bondage in Egypt. During the course of the adventure, our young heroes make it through the plagues, the Exodus from Egypt, and ultimately to the parting of the Red Sea. When the kids return home, they know they have seen God's awesome power at work and believe it must be the greatest bible story ever. At first they are a bit disheartened, believing that if that was the best, most important bible story of all time, then what have they got left to look forward to? However, they quickly perk up when they realize there are hundreds more stories to visit and each one will have it's own unique appeal and adventure.</desc></programme><programme start="20240329131100 +0100" stop="20240329131700 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Kids Health</title><sub-title lang="en">How Your Heart Works</sub-title><desc lang="en">How Your Heart Works</desc></programme><programme start="20240329131700 +0100" stop="20240329134700 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Paternity Court</title><sub-title lang="en">Parents' Lies Jeopardized Her Health</sub-title><desc lang="en">1.
