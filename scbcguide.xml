Táíwò suggests that lack of knowledge on important topics like water and food is what stands between Africa's current state and a future of prosperity. In a powerful talk, he calls for Africa to make the production of knowledge within the continent rewarding and reclaim its position as a locus of learning on behalf of humanity.</desc></programme><programme start="20240220230000 +0100" stop="20240221000000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Dr. Myles Munroe</title><sub-title lang="en">Women Wants to Prove Her Child is Not a Product of Infidelity</sub-title><desc lang="en">This teaching is from the series entitled Kingdom First - Rediscovering God’s Priority Volume 4</desc></programme><programme start="20240221000000 +0100" stop="20240221004800 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 24</title><sub-title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 24</sub-title><desc lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 24</desc></programme><programme start="20240221004800 +0100" stop="20240221010000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">SISTA SHOW Episode 12</title><sub-title lang="en">Season 1 Finale</sub-title><desc lang="en">This episode marks the Season 1 Finale and as always, we have some faya segments lined up for you! </desc></programme><programme start="20240221010000 +0100" stop="20240221012600 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Shamba Shape Up Series 1 - Ep 14</title><sub-title lang="en">Coffee, Maize, Push &amp; pull and Passion fruits</sub-title><desc lang="en">We’re in Walukoto village in Mayuge and we’re visiting Hussein Buyiima and his family on their farm.
