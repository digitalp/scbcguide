Trains and trucks circulate along infrastructure from another age. For trucks in the south of the country, the transport of goods and people take place in the rain and on slippery roads… There is, however, no alternative, as flying is too expensive and the trains are no longer in working condition, except one. This one train travels through half of the country, from the city of Dire Dawa to the border at Djibouti. It travels 310 kilometres over the course of more than 10 hours – on a good day. This last known working train is no stranger to derailments and breaks down on a regular basis. It is the oldest but also the most dangerous train in the world! From the Danakil desert to the rainy summits of the Kaffa region, welcome to Ethiopia!</desc></programme><programme start="20240104195100 +0100" stop="20240104195900 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en" /><sub-title lang="en" /><desc lang="en" /></programme><programme start="20240104195900 +0100" stop="20240104200000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en" /><sub-title lang="en" /><desc lang="en" /></programme><programme start="20240104200000 +0100" stop="20240104204600 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 7 </title><sub-title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 7 </sub-title><desc lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 7 </desc></programme><programme start="20240104204600 +0100" stop="20240104210000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Inside a Lost African Tribe Still Living in India Today | Short Film Showcase</title><sub-title lang="en">Inside a Lost African Tribe Still Living in India Today | Short Film Showcase</sub-title><desc lang="en">In the dense forests of South Asia, a native African tribe has been living in quiet obscurity for more than 500 years.</desc></programme><programme start="20240104210000 +0100" stop="20240104230000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Blade</title><sub-title lang="en">Blade</sub-title><desc lang="en">In a world where vampires walk the earth, Blade has a goal.

The Reaper. A vampire so consumed with an insatiable bloodlust that they prey on vampires as well as humans, transforming victims who are unlucky enough to survive into Reapers themselves. Now their quickly expanding population threatens the existence of vampires, and soon there won't be enough humans in the world to satisfy their bloodlust. Blade, Whistler and an armory expert named Scud are curiously summoned by the Shadow Council. The council reluctantly admits that they are in a dire situation and they require Blade's assistance. Blade then tenuously enters into an alliance with The Bloodpack, an elite team of vampires trained in all modes of combat to defeat the Reaper threat. Blade's team and the Bloodpack are the only line of defense which can prevent the Reaper population from wiping out the vampire and human populations.</desc></programme><programme start="20240105005900 +0100" stop="20240105014500 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 7 </title><sub-title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 7 </sub-title><desc lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 7 </desc></programme><programme start="20240105014500 +0100" stop="20240105015900 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Inside a Lost African Tribe Still Living in India Today | Short Film Showcase</title><sub-title lang="en">Inside a Lost African Tribe Still Living in India Today | Short Film Showcase</sub-title><desc lang="en">In the dense forests of South Asia, a native African tribe has been living in quiet obscurity for more than 500 years.</desc></programme><programme start="20240105015900 +0100" stop="20240105022600 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Shamba Shape Up Series 1 - Ep 7</title><sub-title lang="en">Napier Grass, Growing Vegetables, Cow Care</sub-title><desc lang="en">In this episode the Shamba Shape Up team look at growing Napier grass, harvesting rain water, improving vegetable crop and have more advice on cattle.</desc></programme><programme start="20240105022600 +0100" stop="20240105023000 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="eng">Music</title><title lang="en">Music</title><sub-title lang="eng">Music</sub-title><sub-title lang="en">Music</sub-title><desc lang="eng">Music</desc><desc lang="en">African Music</desc></programme><programme start="20240105023000 +0100" stop="20240105031600 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 6</title><sub-title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 6</sub-title><desc lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 6</desc></programme><programme start="20240105031600 +0100" stop="20240105033100 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="eng">Ted Talk</title><title lang="en">TEDTalk </title><sub-title lang="eng">The thrilling potential for off-grid solar energy | Amar Inamdar</sub-title><sub-title lang="en">The thrilling potential for off-grid solar energy | Amar Inamdar</sub-title><desc lang="eng">There's an energy revolution happening in villages and towns across Africa -- off-grid solar energy is becoming a viable alternative to traditional electricity systems.
