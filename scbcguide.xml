During the course of the adventure, our young heroes make it through the plagues, the Exodus from Egypt, and ultimately to the parting of the Red Sea.

Or when they don't turn at all? Vivek Maru is working to transform the relationship between people and law, turning law from an abstraction or threat into something that everyone can understand, use and shape. Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions. Learn more about how this innovative approach to using the law is helping socially excluded people claim their rights.

Or when they don't turn at all? Vivek Maru is working to transform the relationship between people and law, turning law from an abstraction or threat into something that everyone can understand, use and shape. Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions. Learn more about how this innovative approach to using the law is helping socially excluded people claim their rights. "A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way," Maru says.</desc></programme><programme start="20240125230100 +0100" stop="20240126000100 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Dr. Myles Munroe</title><sub-title lang="en">Understanding The Principles of The Kingdom </sub-title><desc lang="en">This teaching is taken from the series entitled The Power of Kingdom Citizenship</desc></programme><programme start="20240126000100 +0100" stop="20240126004800 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 21</title><sub-title lang="en">Heartbeat Episode 21</sub-title><desc lang="en">Rüzgar goes to Bosnia after losing the woman he loves in a car crash two years ago, to run away from everything and everyone but mostly his memories..
