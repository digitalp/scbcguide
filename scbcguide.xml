During the course of the adventure, our young heroes make it through the plagues, the Exodus from Egypt, and ultimately to the parting of the Red Sea. When the kids return home, they know they have seen God's awesome power at work and believe it must be the greatest bible story ever. At first they are a bit disheartened, believing that if that was the best, most important bible story of all time, then what have they got left to look forward to?
