This prompts Gizmo to question whether they've yet experienced THE GREATEST Bible story of all time. In answer to his question, Superbook whisks the kids away to meet Moses as he is chosen by God to free the Israelites from their bondage in Egypt. During the course of the adventure, our young heroes make it through the plagues, the Exodus from Egypt, and ultimately to the parting of the Red Sea. When the kids return home, they know they have seen God's awesome power at work and believe it must be the greatest bible story ever. At first they are a bit disheartened, believing that if that was the best, most important bible story of all time, then what have they got left to look forward to? However, they quickly perk up when they realize there are hundreds more stories to visit and each one will have it's own unique appeal and adventure.</desc></programme><programme start="20240121165500 +0100" stop="20240121170100 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Kids Health</title><sub-title lang="en">How Your Muscles Work</sub-title><desc lang="en">How Your Muscles Work</desc></programme><programme start="20240121170100 +0100" stop="20240121172600 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em: Season 1, Episode 2</title><sub-title lang="en">George's House</sub-title><desc lang="en">Frank and Betty spend a weekend with her brother George Fisher, who is about to show off his gadget-filled `fool-proof' home, but George soon comes to regret having them over.</desc></programme><programme start="20240121172600 +0100" stop="20240121175800 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en" /><sub-title lang="en" /><desc lang="en" /></programme><programme start="20240121175800 +0100" stop="20240121175900 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en" /><sub-title lang="en" /><desc lang="en" /></programme><programme start="20240121175900 +0100" stop="20240121190300 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">APOCS January 5 2024</title><sub-title lang="en">Tribute to Nera 10 and All APOCS</sub-title><desc lang="en">APOCS January 5 2024</desc></programme><programme start="20240121190300 +0100" stop="20240121205900 +0100" channel="SCBC Television"><title lang="en">Demolition Man</title><sub-title lang="en">Demolition Man</sub-title><desc lang="en">Frozen in 1996, Simon Phoenix, a convicted crime lord, is revived for a parole hearing well into the 21st century.
