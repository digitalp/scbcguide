    <episode_description lang="en">It is Christmas time and the McCallister family is preparing for a vacation in Paris, France. But the youngest in the family, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), got into a scuffle with his older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) and was sent to his room, which is on the third floor of his house. Then, the next morning, while the rest of the family was in a rush to make it to the airport on time, they completely forgot about Kevin, who now has the house all to himself. Being home alone was fun for Kevin, having a pizza all to himself, jumping on his parents' bed, and making a mess. Then, Kevin discovers about two burglars, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), about to rob his house on Christmas Eve. Kevin acts quickly by wiring his own house with makeshift booby traps to stop the burglars and to bring them to justice.</episode_description>

    <episode_description lang="en">Centuries ago in Ancient Egypt, Pharaoh Seti ordered all the male Hebrew babies to be executed. A desperate mother decides to let God guide her newborn son instead of execution. Found by the Queen, the baby is named Moses and brought up as a Prince of Egypt and a brother to the Pharaoh's son Rameses II. As time passes, the two brothers are separated as Moses discovers his true heritage as a Hebrew and defies the Egyptian way of life. After escaping from the city, Moses finds that he is called by God to lead his people out of Egypt as His messenger. Unfortunately, Rameses II now rules over the Hebrews with an iron fist, and it will take all of Moses' strength and God's miracles to change the world.</episode_description>
