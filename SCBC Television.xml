    <episode_description lang="en">Chris has never been this excited. His birthday gift is a HoloStation 4, the ultimate holographic gaming system! It's so popular that there aren't enough to go around for all the kids who want one. Such as the sick boy at the local hospital; even the hospital is unable to pull strings to get him one. Chris feels a twinge of guilt, but it takes SUPERBOOK'S ministrations to turn him around. The kids journey to meet Abraham and his beloved son, Isaac, whom he was willing to sacrifice because it's what God wants. Abraham puts God first in his life, above everything else. This has a profound effect on Chris, who returns home to donate his coveted HoloStation 4 to the little boy at the hospital. He sacrifices what is important to him and does it because he knows it's what God is asking him to do.</episode_description>

    <description lang="en">Motivational</description>
    <episode_description lang="en">How can Africa, the home to some of the largest bodies of water in the world, be said to have a water crisis? It doesn't, says Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò -- it has a knowledge crisis. Táíwò suggests that lack of knowledge on important topics like water and food is what stands between Africa's current state and a future of prosperity. In a powerful talk, he calls for Africa to make the production of knowledge within the continent rewarding and reclaim its position as a locus of learning on behalf of humanity.</episode_description>
