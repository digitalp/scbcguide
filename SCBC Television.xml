    <description lang="en">Motivational</description>
    <episode_description lang="en">What can you do when the wheels of justice don't turn fast enough? Or when they don't turn at all? Vivek Maru is working to transform the relationship between people and law, turning law from an abstraction or threat into something that everyone can understand, use and shape. Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions. Learn more about how this innovative approach to using the law is helping socially excluded people claim their rights. "A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way," Maru says.</episode_description>

    <episode_description lang="eng">There's an energy revolution happening in villages and towns across Africa -- off-grid solar energy is becoming a viable alternative to traditional electricity systems. In a bold talk about a true leapfrog moment, Amar Inamdar introduces us to proud owners of off-grid solar kits -- and explains how this technology has the opportunity to meet two extraordinary goals: energy access for all and a low-carbon future. "Every household a proud producer as well as consumer of energy," Inamdar says. "That's the democracy of energy." (Followed by a brief Q&amp;A with TED Curator Chris Anderson)

    <episode_description lang="en">In South Kivu in Congo, the city of Shabunda is one of the most isolated in the country. Its access is so difficult that life is more expensive there than in any European city. Thus, the poorest families come to look for food there by bicycle or motorbike. These convicts of the road sometimes transport up to 250 kilos of goods for several days, without worrying about the dangers. Without ever giving up, these travelers are almost all considered heroes because "he who does not travel does not know the value of men", according to the Congolese.</episode_description>

    <episode_description lang="en">Rüzgar goes to Bosnia after losing the woman he loves in a car crash two years ago, to run away from everything and everyone but mostly his memories.. He doesn’t make contact with anyone for two years, including his family. His uncle Kemaç and his mother Vahide who is the owner of a major corporation in Turkey, find Ruzgar after long efforts. So Kemal goes to Bosnia to bring Rüzgar back. But Rüzgar is still heartbroken. He can’t live like this so he runs away after a family dinner without telling anyone. He finds himself in Foça after meeting with a taxi driver. Meanwhile Zeynep is about to marry her childhood love Kutay. There’s only a week until the wedding, while the preparations continue Zeynep learns that she was cheated on.  She goes to Foça to her most dear grandpa Muammer and aunt Ayla. However, she faints just before she could get there, right in front of Rüzgar’s house. She hides her true identity from everyone except Rüzgar. Afterwards, Zeynep is forced to see Kutay as her best friend Hande is getting married. Sibel, Başak and Hande think up a plan. But they need Rüzgar to make this plan work. Rüzgar can’t say no to this after hearing what happened to Zeynep.  So a game  of hearts begins between Zeynep and Rüzgar.</episode_description>

    <episode_description lang="eng">There's an energy revolution happening in villages and towns across Africa -- off-grid solar energy is becoming a viable alternative to traditional electricity systems. In a bold talk about a true leapfrog moment, Amar Inamdar introduces us to proud owners of off-grid solar kits -- and explains how this technology has the opportunity to meet two extraordinary goals: energy access for all and a low-carbon future. "Every household a proud producer as well as consumer of energy," Inamdar says. "That's the democracy of energy." (Followed by a brief Q&amp;A with TED Curator Chris Anderson)

    <episode_description lang="en">In South Kivu in Congo, the city of Shabunda is one of the most isolated in the country. Its access is so difficult that life is more expensive there than in any European city. Thus, the poorest families come to look for food there by bicycle or motorbike. These convicts of the road sometimes transport up to 250 kilos of goods for several days, without worrying about the dangers. Without ever giving up, these travelers are almost all considered heroes because "he who does not travel does not know the value of men", according to the Congolese.</episode_description>
