In desperation, he decides to grab the controls, make a list as his roadmap and set out to accomplish life his way. Fifteen years of life on the street and clawing up from the bottom later, we find Jack as a successful lawyer. He's done well on his own, crossed a lot off his list and added more. But, he hasn't factored God into the plan. God hasn't seemed to be around in the past... Can Jack trust Him with the future? As life continues to take its toll and tragedies strike, will Jack relinquish the power of his list in order to gain all he's ever wanted?</episode_description>
