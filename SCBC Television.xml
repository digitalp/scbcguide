    <episode_description lang="en">Chris has never been this excited. His birthday gift is a HoloStation 4, the ultimate holographic gaming system! It's so popular that there aren't enough to go around for all the kids who want one. Such as the sick boy at the local hospital; even the hospital is unable to pull strings to get him one. Chris feels a twinge of guilt, but it takes SUPERBOOK'S ministrations to turn him around. The kids journey to meet Abraham and his beloved son, Isaac, whom he was willing to sacrifice because it's what God wants. Abraham puts God first in his life, above everything else. This has a profound effect on Chris, who returns home to donate his coveted HoloStation 4 to the little boy at the hospital. He sacrifices what is important to him and does it because he knows it's what God is asking him to do.</episode_description>

    <description lang="en">Motivational</description>
    <episode_description lang="en">How can Africa, the home to some of the largest bodies of water in the world, be said to have a water crisis? It doesn't, says Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò -- it has a knowledge crisis. Táíwò suggests that lack of knowledge on important topics like water and food is what stands between Africa's current state and a future of prosperity. In a powerful talk, he calls for Africa to make the production of knowledge within the continent rewarding and reclaim its position as a locus of learning on behalf of humanity.</episode_description>

So Kemal goes to Bosnia to bring Rüzgar back. But Rüzgar is still heartbroken. He can’t live like this so he runs away after a family dinner without telling anyone.

    <episode_description lang="en">In the Quantum yard, during a spirited water fight, Joy accidentally gets Gizmo's inner workings wet and he fritzes out, suddenly believing he belongs to Joy. Chris can't seem to correct the problem and is furious with Joy, saying he'll never forgive her. SUPERBOOK intercedes and whisks the kids back to the days of Jacob and Esau. The two brothers compete over many things, but when Esau gives up his birthright and Jacob tricks his father out of a blessing they become estranged for many years thereafter. Chris and Joy witness the animosity between the two brothers and the separation it has caused them for years. Chris begins to think about his own unforgiving attitude with Joy. When Jacob finally goes to Esau and his brother finds it in his heart to forgive Jacob, Chris takes the cue and forgives Joy as well and the two are best friends once again. And they work together to repair Gizmo's still-comical malfunctioning microchip.</episode_description>

    <episode_description lang="en">On a lazy afternoon, Chris Joy and Gizmo are hanging out in the lab recalling the great adventures they've had with Superbook. This prompts Gizmo to question whether they've yet experienced THE GREATEST Bible story of all time. In answer to his question, Superbook whisks the kids away to meet Moses as he is chosen by God to free the Israelites from their bondage in Egypt. During the course of the adventure, our young heroes make it through the plagues, the Exodus from Egypt, and ultimately to the parting of the Red Sea. When the kids return home, they know they have seen God's awesome power at work and believe it must be the greatest bible story ever. At first they are a bit disheartened, believing that if that was the best, most important bible story of all time, then what have they got left to look forward to? However, they quickly perk up when they realize there are hundreds more stories to visit and each one will have it's own unique appeal and adventure.</episode_description>
