    <episode_description lang="en">As tensions of apartheid spread across South Africa, many students revolts to massive stone throw, a demonstration that comes in a wake of the introduction of Afrikaans language as a means of teaching. This sparks riots among school age young people who have resolved to do what it takes for freedom to come tomorrow. In a township of Soweto, a group of students, led by a beautiful and intelligent young girl, Sarafina, mastermind a plot to rise against the apartheid regime by vehemently rejecting the proposal to have Afrikaans as a medium of instruction. This angers the white people and results in a massive unrest of the students and those others supporting them. Meanwhile, Sarafina's mother accepts a job of a housekeeper in a white household and it angers Sarafina. Following the unrest of students and their possible torture and trial, Sarafina is released from prison, reunites with some of the colleagues and composes a "Freedom is Coming Tomorrow" song</episode_description>

    <episode_description lang="en">In the Quantum yard, during a spirited water fight, Joy accidentally gets Gizmo's inner workings wet and he fritzes out, suddenly believing he belongs to Joy. Chris can't seem to correct the problem and is furious with Joy, saying he'll never forgive her. SUPERBOOK intercedes and whisks the kids back to the days of Jacob and Esau. The two brothers compete over many things, but when Esau gives up his birthright and Jacob tricks his father out of a blessing they become estranged for many years thereafter. Chris and Joy witness the animosity between the two brothers and the separation it has caused them for years. Chris begins to think about his own unforgiving attitude with Joy. When Jacob finally goes to Esau and his brother finds it in his heart to forgive Jacob, Chris takes the cue and forgives Joy as well and the two are best friends once again. And they work together to repair Gizmo's still-comical malfunctioning microchip.</episode_description>

    <episode_description lang="en">On a lazy afternoon, Chris Joy and Gizmo are hanging out in the lab recalling the great adventures they've had with Superbook. This prompts Gizmo to question whether they've yet experienced THE GREATEST Bible story of all time. In answer to his question, Superbook whisks the kids away to meet Moses as he is chosen by God to free the Israelites from their bondage in Egypt. During the course of the adventure, our young heroes make it through the plagues, the Exodus from Egypt, and ultimately to the parting of the Red Sea. When the kids return home, they know they have seen God's awesome power at work and believe it must be the greatest bible story ever. At first they are a bit disheartened, believing that if that was the best, most important bible story of all time, then what have they got left to look forward to? However, they quickly perk up when they realize there are hundreds more stories to visit and each one will have it's own unique appeal and adventure.</episode_description>

    <episode_description lang="en">In the Quantum yard, during a spirited water fight, Joy accidentally gets Gizmo's inner workings wet and he fritzes out, suddenly believing he belongs to Joy. Chris can't seem to correct the problem and is furious with Joy, saying he'll never forgive her. SUPERBOOK intercedes and whisks the kids back to the days of Jacob and Esau. The two brothers compete over many things, but when Esau gives up his birthright and Jacob tricks his father out of a blessing they become estranged for many years thereafter. Chris and Joy witness the animosity between the two brothers and the separation it has caused them for years. Chris begins to think about his own unforgiving attitude with Joy. When Jacob finally goes to Esau and his brother finds it in his heart to forgive Jacob, Chris takes the cue and forgives Joy as well and the two are best friends once again. And they work together to repair Gizmo's still-comical malfunctioning microchip.</episode_description>

    <episode_description lang="en">On a lazy afternoon, Chris Joy and Gizmo are hanging out in the lab recalling the great adventures they've had with Superbook. This prompts Gizmo to question whether they've yet experienced THE GREATEST Bible story of all time. In answer to his question, Superbook whisks the kids away to meet Moses as he is chosen by God to free the Israelites from their bondage in Egypt. During the course of the adventure, our young heroes make it through the plagues, the Exodus from Egypt, and ultimately to the parting of the Red Sea. When the kids return home, they know they have seen God's awesome power at work and believe it must be the greatest bible story ever. At first they are a bit disheartened, believing that if that was the best, most important bible story of all time, then what have they got left to look forward to? However, they quickly perk up when they realize there are hundreds more stories to visit and each one will have it's own unique appeal and adventure.</episode_description>

    <episode_description lang="en">Rüzgar goes to Bosnia after losing the woman he loves in a car crash two years ago, to run away from everything and everyone but mostly his memories.. He doesn’t make contact with anyone for two years, including his family. His uncle Kemaç and his mother Vahide who is the owner of a major corporation in Turkey, find Ruzgar after long efforts. So Kemal goes to Bosnia to bring Rüzgar back. But Rüzgar is still heartbroken. He can’t live like this so he runs away after a family dinner without telling anyone. He finds himself in Foça after meeting with a taxi driver. Meanwhile Zeynep is about to marry her childhood love Kutay. There’s only a week until the wedding, while the preparations continue Zeynep learns that she was cheated on.  She goes to Foça to her most dear grandpa Muammer and aunt Ayla. However, she faints just before she could get there, right in front of Rüzgar’s house. She hides her true identity from everyone except Rüzgar. Afterwards, Zeynep is forced to see Kutay as her best friend Hande is getting married. Sibel, Başak and Hande think up a plan. But they need Rüzgar to make this plan work.

He doesn’t make contact with anyone for two years, including his family. His uncle Kemaç and his mother Vahide who is the owner of a major corporation in Turkey, find Ruzgar after long efforts. So Kemal goes to Bosnia to bring Rüzgar back. But Rüzgar is still heartbroken. He can’t live like this so he runs away after a family dinner without telling anyone.

There’s only a week until the wedding, while the preparations continue Zeynep learns that she was cheated on.  She goes to Foça to her most dear grandpa Muammer and aunt Ayla.

Afterwards, Zeynep is forced to see Kutay as her best friend Hande is getting married. Sibel, Başak and Hande think up a plan. But they need Rüzgar to make this plan work.

    <description lang="en">Motivational</description>
    <episode_description lang="en">What can you do when the wheels of justice don't turn fast enough? Or when they don't turn at all? Vivek Maru is working to transform the relationship between people and law, turning law from an abstraction or threat into something that everyone can understand, use and shape. Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions. Learn more about how this innovative approach to using the law is helping socially excluded people claim their rights. "A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way," Maru says.</episode_description>

    <episode_description lang="en">Rüzgar goes to Bosnia after losing the woman he loves in a car crash two years ago, to run away from everything and everyone but mostly his memories.. He doesn’t make contact with anyone for two years, including his family. His uncle Kemaç and his mother Vahide who is the owner of a major corporation in Turkey, find Ruzgar after long efforts. So Kemal goes to Bosnia to bring Rüzgar back. But Rüzgar is still heartbroken. He can’t live like this so he runs away after a family dinner without telling anyone. He finds himself in Foça after meeting with a taxi driver. Meanwhile Zeynep is about to marry her childhood love Kutay. There’s only a week until the wedding, while the preparations continue Zeynep learns that she was cheated on.  She goes to Foça to her most dear grandpa Muammer and aunt Ayla. However, she faints just before she could get there, right in front of Rüzgar’s house. She hides her true identity from everyone except Rüzgar. Afterwards, Zeynep is forced to see Kutay as her best friend Hande is getting married. Sibel, Başak and Hande think up a plan. But they need Rüzgar to make this plan work. Rüzgar can’t say no to this after hearing what happened to Zeynep.  So a game  of hearts begins between Zeynep and Rüzgar.</episode_description>

    <description lang="en">Motivational</description>
    <episode_description lang="en">What can you do when the wheels of justice don't turn fast enough? Or when they don't turn at all? Vivek Maru is working to transform the relationship between people and law, turning law from an abstraction or threat into something that everyone can understand, use and shape. Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions. Learn more about how this innovative approach to using the law is helping socially excluded people claim their rights. "A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way," Maru says.</episode_description>
